Growth Dominance Coefficient (GDC) is an indicator comparing the contribution to the stand growth between larger and smaller trees.
It is defined as positive when larger trees in the stand display proportionally greater growth than smaller trees, and negative when smaller trees display greater growth than larger trees.
It can be used to assess the efficacy of thinning treatments designed to reduce the source competition between trees and promote high levels of productivity.

Belows are detailed explanations of applying GDC in the forest resource management.
### Phase 1: Null Growth Dominance (Early development)
Resource competition is low and total stand growth is proportionate to its mass.
### Phase 2: Positive Growth Dominance
Larger trees gain dominance, increase their use of resources, and suppress the â€ƒgrowth of smaller trees.
### Phase 3: Null Growth Dominance
Larger trees grow more slowly due to one or more factors.
### Phase 4: Negative Growth Dominance (Reverse growth dominance)
Smaller trees contribute more to the total stand growth.

### Selected Experiment Site
Current Stands Condition:
This stand consists of 41 trees, among which 27 trees are in fair/good growing conditions. Over half of them are Ash trees.
The age class of the current stand is diversified, ranging from 2.4 - 56 years old. According to the Growth Dominance Coefficient, the stand is in the fourth phase -- the reverse growth dominance -- where smaller trees contribute more to the total stand growth.
